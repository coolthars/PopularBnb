## Problem Statement and Business Case:

Analyse big data (250GB+) to construct a platform for Airbnb renters and investors to help them plan trips or make investment decisions.
This project shows airbnb price along with weather information, for the whole year from January to December allowing travelers plan their trip wisely based on their budget, available time and their preference for weather or temperature conditions to the selected city. For example you might not care much between visiting London or Paris or also between January or February, and having knowledge about average prices in cities and months and average temperature can help you with your decision making process a lot.
This project also shows the average price variation and the number of listings variations over past years for selected city giving insights to investors on airbnb.
